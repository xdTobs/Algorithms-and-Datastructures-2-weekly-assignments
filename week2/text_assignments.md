### a
if the graph is a path, with three nodes [a,b,c] with edges [[a,b][b,c]]
and having the weights [4,5,4], then the first step would remove the "b" node, and wouldn't get the maximum independent set.

### b
If the graph is a path, with four nodes [a,b,c,d] with edges [[a,b][b,c],[c,d]]
and having the weights [5,1,1,4], then S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> would be [a,c] and [b,d] respectively, and the algorithm would return [a,c] as the maximum independent set. When the max set is [a,d].

### c
